# Days-Since
Days-Since is a Full CRUD Full Stack application that I built as my Final-Capstone at Nashville Software School.  
The Application was built to aid Multiple-Sclerosis patients in tracking their disease progression over time.

A user can track their daily symptoms and view their all time average symptom levels, journal about their day, set goals
and log them if completed, and also post helpful articles that correlate to the disease.
