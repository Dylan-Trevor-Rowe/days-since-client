# Days-Since
Days-Since is a Full CRUD Full Stack application that I built as my final-capstone at Nashville Software School.  
The Application was built to aid Multiple-Sclerosis patients in tracking their disease progression over time.

A user can track their daily symptoms, view their all time average (sleep, emotional-well-being, pain and fatigue scales), journal about their day, set goals
and log them if completed, and also post and comment on helpful articles that correlate to the disease.
